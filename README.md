# Social Network Ads - SVM Classifier

This repository contains a machine learning project completed as part of my 3rd-year studies in Computer Systems (6th semester) for the Artificial Intelligence module.

## 📂 Project Overview

The goal of the project is to build and evaluate a **Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier** that predicts whether a user will purchase a product based on their information from a social network.

- **Module:** Artificial Intelligence
- **Academic Year:** 3rd year, 6th semester
- **Course:** Computer Systems
- **Algorithm Used:** Support Vector Machine (SVM)

## 📊 Dataset

- **Name:** Social_Network_Ads.csv
- **Features:**
  - User ID
  - Gender
  - Age
  - Estimated Salary
  - Purchased (Target)

The dataset is used to train and test the model to classify user purchase behavior.

## 🛠️ Technologies

- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib / Seaborn (for visualization)
- Pandas & NumPy

## 📈 Project Steps

1. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - Handling missing values
   - Encoding categorical data
   - Splitting dataset into Training and Test sets
   - Feature Scaling

2. **Model Training:**
   - SVM classifier using Scikit-learn

3. **Evaluation:**
   - Confusion Matrix
   - Accuracy score
   - Visualization of training and test set results
